# Color Changing & Automatic LED

## The Challenge:
One of the main problems that are very common nowadays is wasting electricity by using it when it is not needed. This issue leads to many bigger issues like global warming and perhaps more electrical malfunctions. 

## The Solution:
Hence, this project helps tackle the mentioned problem by programming an LED to work automatically in the dark and get turned off when it is no longer necessary. Moreover, the LED could also switch colors with every button click to make the product more appealing to the user.
